# Article Summarizer Application using OpenAI's GPT model

React, Redux, RapidAPI, Tailwind

Alongside building this application, I learn how to:
- setup a ReactJS project using Vite
- create a responsive, beautiful UI/UX with a nice touch of glass morphism using Tailwind CSS
- make advanced RTK query API requests that fire on condition
- save history using the local storage
- handle form events and catch errors
- implement copy to clipboard
- write clean code
